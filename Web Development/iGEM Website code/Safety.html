            <p class="con">
                There are a lot of potential safety hazards in biological experiments, 
                particularly those related to microorganism. In order to avoid the occurrence 
                of hidden dangers, we have made some preparations. In details, we strictly 
                abided the rules announced by iGEM safety committee and took the 
                laboratory safety training before we conducted our laboratory work. We will 
                introduce our approaches specifically on this page.

            <p class="title">Safty Form & Check-In Form</p>
            <p class="con1">
                First of all, we submitted the safety form as a team, providing information about our potential risk as much as possible (Figure 1). To be more 
                specific, all the parts and chassis organism in our project are from organisms or organisms themselves at safety level 1 or 2, which meets the 
                requirement from iGEM safety committee.

            <p class="con2">
                Secondly, considering that we also used parts from organisms or organisms themselves that are not within the whitelist of safety form, we 
                submitted check-in form to put those parts on record. We submitted check-in form for every part that has potential risk, and all these forms have 
                been approved by safety committee.

            <p class="con black">
                Laboratory work is an essential part in iGEM competition. Most of iGEM teams should conduct some lab works in order to demonstrate their 
                project. However, the safety concern is crucial for lab conduction. For our high school student, there are many unfamiliar equipment for us, some 
                of which like centrifuge might even cause dangers for lab workers. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety during lab works, all of our teammates 
                were trained by Bluepha Lab, in which laboratory managers from Bluepha explained basic laboratory safety concerns and the correct way to use 
                a specific equipment. After the general training, we were also required to pass a lab safety assessment before we officially started our 
                experiments. Additionally, we were provided with a laboratory notebook (Figure 2), in which some basic protocols like E. coli transformation were 
                documented to help us to do experiments successfully. Here we sincerely thank Bluepha Lab for their safety training and laboratory support.
