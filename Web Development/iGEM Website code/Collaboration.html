            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                In order to share our experiences and learn more knowledge from other 
                teams, we collaborated with QHFZ_China, SHSBNU_China, GDSYZX, and 
                Keystone this time. Through the collaboration, we not only refined some 
                imperfect project design but also achieved the production of bacterial 
                cellulose in large scale. Besides, communications with other teams also gave 
                us some helpful enlightenments, raising some new ideas that are noteworthy.

                        In August 2020, we attended the meet up hosted by QHFZ_China 
                        to share our project description and design with other teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        To begin with, we stated the current situation of the leathery 
                        industry as a foreword to introduce our project about bacterial 
                        cellulose. In order to solve the problems that exist nowadays, he 
                        said that we plan to produce environmental-friendly leathery, 
                        which has great physical properties, while maintaining the 
                        conservation of animals and environment.

                    <p>
                        After our presentation, we received lots of kind suggestions from 
                        QHFZ_China and other teams attending this meetup. Accordingly, 
                        we also sent out our own advice for other teams.

            <p class="title">Online Communication With QHFZ_China</p>
            <p class="con">
                In March 2020, we collaborated with QHFZ_China through an online communication (Figure 1). First of all, Tianhong Li, the advisor of 
                QHFZ_China, invited us to deliver an online sharing session for QHFZ teammates. In details, Tianhong Li considered the importance to let new 
                iGEMers be familiar with iGEM community as soon as possible, and we totally agreed with this viewpoint. Therefore, our presentation was mainly 
                about the basic information of iGEM and the operation of BNDS_China, which serves to be a reference for the team management of 
                QHFZ_China.
            </p>
            <p class="con">
                First of all, we introduced our recruitment and selection methods. Here we emphasized that iGEM was an attractive competition in our school 
                because near 100 students were interested in participating iGEM 2020, and we had to make a selection among them. In this way, we hoped 
                iGEMers in QHFZ_China would be aware of the significance of iGEM competition and work hard.

                    <p>
                        Moving on, we also talked about how team 
                        members in BNDS_China were trained. For 
                        example, we shared the way how we teach 
                        our freshmen to use Snapgene to perform 
                        molecular cloning to QHFZ_China. 
                        Additionally, we also highlighted the 
                        importance of literature research and 
                        suggested them to hold Journal Club 
                        regularly.

                    <p>
                        At last, we expressed my wish to reach 
                        friendly collaboration with QHFZ_China and 
                        sincerely wished both teams could get a 
                        good result in the end.

                        Through this online communication, we 
                        became familiar with each other. More 
                        importantly, this communication was also the 
                        basis of our later attendance in the meetup 
                        hosted by QHFZ_China.

                    Our team has designed an oscillatory incubator, which can be compatible with a culture flask for large-scale culture of bacteria when we 
                    experimenting in the Bluepha Lab. We do that is because the incubator there can only be compatible with the culture tube but cannot deal with 
                    the culture flag with a large volume. And also, the temperature is usually set at 37 degrees, which cannot be changed. From this point of view, our 
                    transformation is particularly important when doing some experiments that need flask or higher temperatures. 
                </p>
                <p class="con">
                    And because the team SHSBNU_China needs a variable temperature incubator, we lent them our oscillatory incubator to help them set the right 
                    temperature to complete their project.

                <p class="con">
                    We made an appointment for an online meeting with the GDXYZX team this year. And in the meeting, we communicate about the projects and 
                    put forward opinions on each other's plans on how to do the project.

                <p class="con">
                    In the process of communication, we found that an inducible promoter in their project cannot produce the desired product after concatenating a 
                    gene. In this case, we suggest that they can replace the target gene with a reporter CDS, such as pigment-protein or fluorescent protein. In this 
                    way, we can test whether their inducible promoter can work or not by judging the color change of the chassis organism, which helps the team 
                    solve this problem.

                        In order to realize the mass production of cellulose, we need to design a more complex hardware, the Rotary Disc 
                        Reactor which also increases the difficulty of construction. Thus, it is difficult for our team to construct the 
                        hardware by ourselves due to the limited team members and working space. Our instructor Songyuan Zhang 
                        helped us get in touch with team KEYSTONE_A. Since bacterial cellulose was involved in the projects of both 
                        teams, we decided to work together to construct the hardware. See more information in our partnership 
                        webpage.
