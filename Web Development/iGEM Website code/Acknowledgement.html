            <h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h1>
            <p>
                During iGEM 2020, we received lots of help from others, including individuals
                and organizations. We sincerely thank everyone who supported us during the
                great journey in iGEM 2020. As for acknowledgement, we documented
                contributions from people or organization that helped us.

                    <p>
                        Ms. Hu (Figure 1) was the manager of 798 bar. When we were trying 
                        to produce bacteria cellulose, we wanted to use waste beer yeast as 
                        a cheaper material for culture media. Therefore, hoping to gain a 
                        more concrete view of the waste beer yeast, we interviewed Ms. Hu 
                        about the production of beer residue during fermentation. Moreover, 
                        we also learned the current situation regarding the waste treatment 
                        process of waste beer yeast from her statement. As a result, we 
                        planned to obtain some sample of waster beer yeast in order to 
                        apply it to our G. xylinus fermentation, providing an innovative 
                        scheme for the waste treatment of beer dregs. See more details in 
                        our HP website.

                    <p>
                        Mr. Gong (Figure 2) is a master in ancient paper making technology. 
                        Considering that the shaping process of our bacterial cellulose is 
                        similar to the technology in papermaking industry, we interviewed Mr. 
                        Gong in order to learn papermaking process in a more detailed way 
                        and use those technologies to reshape our bacterial cellulose. During 
                        the interview, Mr. Gong firstly introduced an overview of 
                        papermaking, and then emphasized some points for attention in the 
                        paper reshaping process, which is very helpful for our iGEM 2020 
                        project. See more details in our HP website.

                    <p>
                        Our project, to manufacture artificial leather from the 
                        combination of cellulose and protein crosslinking, has the aim of 
                        protecting wild animals from being killed for their leather. Since 
                        our project accords with the concept of conservation suggested 
                        by iGEM Revive & Restore Committee, we applied for the Revive 
                        & Restore sponsorship in May. Finally, we were selected to receive 
                        a Revive & Restore iGEM 2020 grant, so we managed to gain the 
                        $5500 sponsorship (Figure 3). We felt grateful towards the 
                        support from iGEM Revive & Restore Committee.

                            Considering that the price of experiment reagent like enzymes might 
                            not be affordable for our high school students, we asked NEB for 
                            sponsorship about life science laboratory supply. Fortunately, NEB 
                            approved our request for sponsorship and supported us by delivering 
                            reagents (Figure 4), particularly for molecular cloning, which helped 
                            us a lot in the experiment part.

                <p>
                    As two softwares, Snapgene and Geneious Prime are well-known in iGEM community for a long time because they are really two powerful tools
                    for designing plasmids, importing sequence, performing molecular cloning, and so on. Therefore, almost every iGEMer had used these two 
                    applications during the iGEM career. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Considering that we need to design our experiment and analyze experiment result in a convenient way, we asked Snapgene and Geneious Prime 
                    for sponsorship in November 2019 and June 2020. Our request was quickly approved (Figure 5). In details, Snapgene and Geneious Prime 
                    sponsored their free licenses to our team so that we can design our experiment efficiently. Each member in our team learned how we could use 
                    these two applications to simulate experiment before conduction and make judgment regarding experiment result.
