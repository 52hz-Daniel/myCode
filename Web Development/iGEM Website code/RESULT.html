            <p class="con1 black">We achieved the production of bacterial cellulose through static culture. There is visible bacterial cellulose in the culture flask with HS media 
                (Figure 1A). Quantitatively speaking, the wet weight of bacterial cellulose produced by G. xylinus in static culture is 17.847g, while the dry weight is 
                1.012g on average (Figure 1B).

                As for the production of bacterial cellulose by Rotary Disc Reactor (RDR), because of the current pandemic of COVID-19, we haven’t performed 
                experiments in this part. However, we have successfully constructed the hardware and debugged all the potential errors. We hope to implement 
                the fermentation via RDR in the next iGEM competition.

                        We tried to purify SpyCatcher003 and SpyTag003 based on two 
                        chassis organisms: and P. Pastoris and E. coli. However, the 
                        transformation and protein purification process for P. Pastoris are 
                        both troublesome. For the chemical transformation, the efficiency is 
                        not so ideal, which means that we need to repeat the 
                        transformation for many times in order to gain the correct clone. For 
                        the electroporation, although the efficiency is acceptable, the 
                        protocol for electroporation equipment is complex and also a little 
                        dangerous. Therefore, we finally achieved the successful 
                        transformation of P. Pastoris with genes responsible for 
                        SpyCatcher003 and SpyTag003 integrated with structural proteins 
                        according to genome PCR (Figure 2). However, we didn’t finish the 
                        subsequent protein purification process due to the limit of time.

                E. coli might be attributed to the length of CDS. The DNA length of SpyCatcher003 with cellulose binding module and SpyTag003 with structural 
                proteins are both about 4kb, which might be exceedingly long beyond the endurance limit of E. coli. Another reason is that protease inhibitor was

                Our project was negatively affected by COVID-19 pandemic. However, our team members for this year and the prospective team leaders for 
                iGEM 2021 BNDS_China all feel that this project is worthy to be continued. Therefore, we choose to be a Two-Phase project for the next year 
                iGEM competition. Our project next year would be based on the theoretical design and modeling prediction done in iGEM 2020, moving forward 
                to experiment implementation if the pandemic were relieved.

                For the production of bacterial cellulose via RDR, we plan to manufacture the hardware in large scale so that we could have multiple equipment 
                working at the same time to achieve the mass production of bacterial cellulose. Moreover, we decided to adopt Yamanaka Medium Ethanol 
                (YME), which is a brand-new culture media for the production of bacterial cellulose with more nutrition, in order to enhance the productivity. In 
                addition, the strain for cellulose production could be various. We plan to make a comparison between G. xylinus, G. hansenii, and several other 
                kinds of cellulose producing strain in order to find the optimized one.
            </p>
            <p class="con">
                For the protein purification, we decided to make thorough investigation regarding the fermentation conditions for P. Pastoris. For example, the 
                concentration of methanol, the inducer for the protein expression in P. Pastoris, is debatable according to academic literature report. Moreover, 
                the different integration site of linearized expression cassette in P. Pastoris genome would influence the utilization efficiency of methanol, 
                producing the Mut+ type (normal methanol utilization) and MutS type (slow methanol utilization). The choice of different integration sites is also 
                debatable, so we decide to try both and adopt the better one. As for the protein expression in E. coli, we plan to verify the endurance limit of this 
                chassis and add protease inhibitor to avoid digestion of target proteins. If the protein expression in E. coli still didn’t work, we would focus on P. 
                Pastoris only.
            </p>
            <p class="con">
                In conclusion, we are looking forward to further continuing this project in iGEM 2021 as a Two-Phase project. With the basis of theoretical design 
                and analysis, we believe that our experiment implementation would flow well next year.
