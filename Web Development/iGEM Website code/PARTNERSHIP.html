                        In order to realize the mass production of cellulose, 
                        we need to design a more complex hardware, the 
                        Rotary Disc Reactor which also increases the difficulty 
                        of construction. Thus, it is difficult for our team to 
                        construct the hardware by ourselves due to the 
                        limited team members and working space. Our 
                        instructor Songyuan Zhang helped us get in touch 
                        with team KEYSTONE_A. Since bacterial cellulose was 
                        involved in the projects of both teams, we decided to 
                        work together to construct the hardware.

                        Our team is responsible for the design of the Rotary 
                        Disc Reactor. We came up with the idea of Rotary 
                        Disc Reactor and put forward specific details in 
                        designation. Our team members designed both the 
                        structure of culture tank and the electrical system 
                        (Fig.1). We also prepare and customize all the required 
                        materials through Internet.

                Our team members and members from KEYSTONE_A constructed the hardware during the summer vacation. Two teams jointly completed the 
                initial construction work and completed the hardware that can be basically operated (Fig.2). However, when students from KEYSTONE_A helped 
                to do the user test, they found that the PWM driving board in the circuit had problems with its stability. After long-term continuous operating, 
                the temperature was too high in the circuit and the fuse in the PWM driving board was easy to blow. KEYSTONE_Aâ€™s students helped us 
                troubleshoot this problem. They successively replaced the original equipment with customized PWM driving board, which improved the stability 
                and safety of the circuit (Fig.3).

            <p class="textcen2">
                The final result was a success to both of our teams. We have finished the assembly of the entire hardware and the idling test proved that it could 
                work well continuously for more than 24 hours. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our experiments were limited and we could only finish the theory 
                part of our project. Thus, the Rotary Disc Reactor will be put into practical usage in the second phase of our project next year. Both of our teams 
                are looking forward to further cooperation next year (Fig.4).
