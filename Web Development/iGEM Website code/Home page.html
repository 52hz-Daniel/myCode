                Wild animalâ€™s leathers have great values for the clothing and fashion industry. 
                Some luxury products like crocodile bag even require leather from rare 
                species. This profitable business drives poachers to illegally hunt and hurt 
                those wild animals. The demands of leather put the wild animals in a 
                dangerous place and the harms caused by poaching for species conservation 
                is unthinkable. Therefore, we aimed to integrate bacterial cellulose and 
                protein crosslinking to manufacture artificial leather for animal conservation. 
                Specifically, we utilized G. xylinus to synthesize bacterial cellulose. Moreover, 
                we engineered E. coli and P. Pastoris to purify collagen-like protein and 
                spider fibroin with SpyCatcher003 and SpyTag003 for protein crosslinking. 
                This synthetic biological method provides an alternative way to supply raw 
                material for leather industry, while ensuring animal and environment 
                conversation.

                        BNDS_China aims to manufacture artificial leather via 
                        synthetic biology. We adopted the bacterial cellulose as 
                        the backbone and structural proteins for crosslinking. We 
                        produced bacterial cellulose by the fermentation of G. 
                        xylinus and purified proteins by P. pastoris and E. coli.

                        We did HP about the waste beer yeast and paper making 
                        technologies and integrated them into our project. Click

                        We conducted our experiment in order to implement the 
                        final goal of our project. However, due to the current 
                        pandemic, we met tremendous challenge and difficulties. 
                        As a result, our lab achievements were not ideal, but 
                        some parts do make sense. Click to see more details
