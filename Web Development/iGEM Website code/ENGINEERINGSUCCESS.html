                Bacterial cellulose has been adopted in iGEM project for many years as a polymer with bright future in
                material science. For example, the project of iGEM 2014 Imperial is just about the application of
                bacterial cellulose in water purification. No matter what project we plan to do, the mass production of
                bacterial cellulose is always crucial as long as the project is related to it. However, methods proposed
                by previous iGEM team are not ideal. It’s noteworthy that all those methods adopted static culture for
                the fermentation of G. xylinus, which is an extremely inefficient way for the biosynthesis of bacterial
                cellulose. Therefore, the method for the efficient production of bacterial cellulose would be a great
                contribution to iGEM community. Accordingly, iGEM 2020 BNDS_China aimed to improve the previous methods
                in order to manufacture bacterial cellulose in a convenient and efficient way.

                Firstly，we can describe the relationship of gel point Pc and the amount of functionality in SpyTag003
                and SpyCatcher003 with the following equation:<br />
                In which and are the functionality of SpyTag003 and SpyCatcher003, and are the number of monomers
                containing functional groups in SpyTag003 and SpyCatcher003.

            <div class="eng-btn-title">The graph colored as blue represents the plane whose value is zero.</div>
            <p class="eng-module2-p">By Solving for the critical condition where the function equals 0, the two
                functions of critical ratio
                are attained.<br />
                We can therefore derive the function of the maximum and minimum ratio for gelation to occur of the
                fraction of Na and Nb：<br />
                Where x=Na+Nb，and g1 and g2 are the functions describing the two critical conditions.</p>
            <p class="eng-module2-p">By plotting the graph, we find out that both the lower critical bound and upper
                critical bound of the
                ratio of SpyTag003 and SpyCatcher003 that can form the gel are around 0.8. Therefore, we can conclude
                that the best ratio between SpyTag003 and SpyCatcher003 is 0.8.</p>
