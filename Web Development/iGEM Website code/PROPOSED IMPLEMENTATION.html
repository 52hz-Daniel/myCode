            <p class="con">
                To do a project regarding an issue in our daily life, we need to think about 
                the implementation of our project in reality (Figure 1). Therefore, we should 
                identify the end-users related to artificial leather, envision the 
                implementation of our project by others, analyze the application of our 
                project, and consider some potential challenges like safety issues.

                We firstly worked on the project in laboratory by culturing E. coli, P. Pastoris, and G. xylinus to synthesize some essential biomaterials such as bacterial cellulose and 
                recombinant structural proteins. After that, cellulose backbone and structural proteins are integrated together, which forms our artificial leather. Finally, we would transfer 
                the manufacture of artificial leather from a laboratory context to an industry context for commercialization.

                    <p class="con">
                        As our project can be defined as “an alternative artificial leather based on cellulose backbone and SpyTag003-SpyCatcher003 protein 
                        crosslinking”, the end-users of our project are those people working in leather industry, who want to experience “leathers” with enhanced 
                        mechanical properties, who care about wild lives and its protection, and who are seeking the way towards betterment for our planet.

                    <p class="con">
                        We are looking forward to seeing others using our project. With the help of our pollution-free, degradable, customizable super-leather, leather 
                        industry would be provided an alternative for animal leather, for which leather producers could manufacture environmentally friendly leather with 
                        high structural strength, while conserving wild animal resource. With the reshape technique applied to our enhanced “leathers”, our products 
                        allow others to use them in various shapes and forms, bags, clothes, placemats, all of which durable made. To combine those two great 
                        mechanisms, numerous products with leather-like endurance and touch as well as 100% customizable patterns can be used in areas of clothing, 
                        packaging, and even medical fields.

            <p class="con1 black">
                In the real-world applications, our project offers an incomparable opportunity to build a completely green production line when leather-like 
                features are what end-producers aim for. The mass production of enhanced “leather” can be carried out with the help of end-wastes from the 
                beer brewing industry, where G. xylinus can find precious yeast bodies full of nutritive proteins and essential salts. With our products been made, 
                the brewing industry can then order promoting accessories with their slogans and brand on them. In the same way, our products can repay the 
                paper-making industry which brought us inspiration for Reshaping techniques by carrying forward this traditional culture and eco-friendly idea.

            <p class="title bluebold">Safety Concern And Other Challenges</p>
            <p class="con2 black">
                Concerning to the safety and potential usage as medical-grade textiles, all of our products should be completely sterilized and purified to 
                remove endotoxin before getting out of our laboratory. Moreover, in our project, chassis organisms like P. Pastoris, E. coli, and G. xylinus are all at 
                biosafety level 1, which would not cause any biosafety issue.
