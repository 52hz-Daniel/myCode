                Bacterial cellulose has been adopted in iGEM project for many years as a polymer with bright future in
                material science. For example, the project of iGEM 2014 Imperial is just about the application of
                bacterial cellulose in water purification. No matter what project we plan to do, the mass production of
                bacterial cellulose is always crucial as long as the project is related to it. However, methods proposed
                by previous iGEM team are not ideal. It’s noteworthy that all those methods adopted static culture for
                the fermentation of G. xylinus, which is an extremely inefficient way for the biosynthesis of bacterial
                cellulose. Therefore, the method for the efficient production of bacterial cellulose would be a great
                contribution to iGEM community. Accordingly, iGEM 2020 BNDS_China aimed to improve the previous methods
                in order to manufacture bacterial cellulose in a convenient and efficient way.

                Rotary disc reactor (RDR) has been proposed a long time ago. In details, RDR is an innovative bioreactor
                for the fermentation of G. xylinus in large scale. The core components of RDR are a motor, an axis, and
                several plates (Figure 1). To be more specific, the axis is connected with the motor, while plates are
                anchored on the axis. Therefore, the rotation of motor will drive the rotation of plates1. Because about
                half of the plates are immersed under culture media, the rotation of plates will strike the culture
                media. It has been suggested in literature that the adoption of RDR could significantly enhance the
                production of bacterial cellulose2. Therefore, we decided to design and construct an RDR for the mass
                production of bacterial cellulose.
