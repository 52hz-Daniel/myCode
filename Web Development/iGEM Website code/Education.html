            <p>
                As a tradition that continues from 2016, BNDS_China prepares for the recruitment of the prospective
                iGEMers in every September, passing on previous knowledge and experiences. For the sake of helping them
                to get a basic understanding of synthetic biology, we choose to use BioBuilder as the textbook to assist
                their learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, BioBuilder writes the part "molecular cloning" in a very general way, causing the prospective
                iGEMers confused a lot; we also hear some feedback and complaint regarding that. In this way, we decide
                to hold a meeting, teaching them more specific points about molecular cloning, allowing them to prepare
                for being a real iGEMer in the future.

                <p class="edu-module2-p white">
                    Considering many specific factors, we decide to hold an online meeting during the National Day to
                    present our materials to the prospective iGEMers. Because we are all high school students, academic
                    pressure and various extra-curriculum activities make it difficult for us to meet offline to discuss
                    regularly. And more importantly, due to the COVID-19, we should avoid face-to-face contact as much
                    as
                    possible. Besides that, most of the students have more flexible time during the National Day
                    holiday,
                    which is an excellent opportunity for us to use the convenient internet to access wider audiences
                    and
                    then attract them to attend our presentation. Just like offline, our presenters and the students can
                    interact in real-time to solve some remaining questions. Additionally, we can record the whole
                    meeting
                    and make it into a valuable video material to help more students. Based on these considerations, we
                    eventually choose to hold this online presentation on National Day.

                <p class="title bluebold">Implementation</p>
                <p class="edu-3-box-p">We conducted two online meetings during the National Day holiday to teach
                    prospective iGEMers some specific knowledge about synthetic biology, allowing them to have a glimpse
                    of what is synthetic biology looks like. </p>
                <p class="edu-3-box-p">For the first meeting (Figure 1), Jingcheng Yu talked about several significant
                    definitions and processes in Biochemistry. Firstly, he introduced the basic structure of RNA and
                    DNA, as well as their marked characteristics, which is the foundation of more complicated things in
                    synthetic biology. Although this is relatively simple, if the prospective iGEMers don’t understand
                    this first, they will confuse a lot. Moving on, he explained the central dogma of molecular biology:
                    replication, transcription, and translation. Besides that, Jingcheng Yu also briefly introduced the
                    Polymerase chain reaction, which is one of the important techniques that will be used in future iGEM
                    research.

                <p class="edu-3-box-p">For the second meeting (Figure 2), Wanji Li introduced one of the difficulties in
                    synthetic biology:
                    molecular cloning. Firstly, he reviewed the materials presented in the first meeting, such as the
                    structure of DNA, further strengthening prospective iGEMer’s memory and understanding about these
                    basic points. Next, after talking about several significant enzymes in molecular cloning, he
                    explained three different kinds of cloning, which is traditional cloning, BioBrick Assembly, and
                    Gibson Assembly, as well as the advantages of each of them. Understanding the principles behind
                    these techniques can benefit the prospective iGEMers a lot during future learning and project
                    design.

                    thus we can publish the
                    video online to reach wider audiences, improving our educational significance.</p>

                <p class="edu-module4-p white">
                    For these two meetings, it is great that we used an innovative way to allow the prospective iGEMers
                    to get a basic understanding of synthetic biology before joining BNDS_2021. Moreover, we helped
                    clear the way for the prospective iGEMers to learn synthetic biology and eliminated the confusion
                    aroused during reading BioBuilder, especially the part of molecular cloning, gradually improving the
                    ability of future team members. On this other hand, due to the COVID-19, our preparation time for
                    this activity is relatively limited, so we only held on two online meetings, which is far from
                    enough. In this way, we decide to conduct a series of such meetings and record them into videos, in
                    order to present our materials systematically.
